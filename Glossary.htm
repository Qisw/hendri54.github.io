    <td><h2>Macro Concepts</h2>
    <p><strong>ECI:&nbsp; </strong>Employment cost index. Measures total compensation paid to
    workers, including both wages and salaries and the cost of benefits such as health plans.</p>
    <p><b>Labor force:</b> All employed and unemployed persons. The labor force
    participation rate is the ratio of the labor force to the working age
    population.</p>
    <p><strong>NAIRU:</strong>&nbsp; &quot;Non-accelerating inflation rate of
    unemployment.&quot; The unemployment rate that is consistent with constant inflation.</p>
    <p><strong>Okun's law</strong>: A negative relationship between the change in unemployment
    and growth. Allows ot estimate the GDP growth rate that is sustainable in the long-run.</p>
    <p><strong>Phillips curve</strong>:&nbsp; A negative relationship between inflation and
    unemployment. Many versions exist. There is wide agreement that the long-run Phillips
    curve is vertical: Additional inflation does not buy higher employment.
    <p><b>Recession</b>: A downturn in the business cycle. There are many
    operational definitions such as &quot;2 consecutive quarters with negative
    real GDP growth.&quot; The official dating is done by an NBER committee. It
    does not follow strict rules, but uses judgement.
    <p><b>Unemployment:</b>&nbsp; Persons are categorized as employed,
    unemployed, or not in the labor force. A person counts as unemployed, if
    he/she is not currently employed, but looking for a job or waiting for a job
    to start. All other non-employed are not considered part of the labor force.
    This includes those who have given up the job search process (the
    discouraged).</td>

    <p><strong>Moral hazard:</strong>&nbsp; Agents engage in excessive risk-taking because
    they are covered by some form of insurance.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><h2>Statistical Terminology</h2>
    <p><strong>Mean: </strong>Average value of a random variable</p>
    <p><strong>Normal distribution</strong>:&nbsp; (Gaussian distribution)&nbsp; The
    well-known bell-shaped distribution. Many &quot;natural&quot; processes generate normally
    distributed random variables. For example: Toss a coin many times and count the fraction
    coming up &quot;heads.&quot; This is normally distributed.</p>
    <p><strong>Standard deviation</strong>: Average size of the fluctuation of a random
    variable. Square root of the variance. Example: The standard deviation of business cycle
    peaks for GDP is 1.7%. This means that on average GDP is 1.7% above its trend level at the
    end of a boom. </p>
    <p><strong>Trend</strong>:&nbsp; Draw a smooth line through a time series and you get its
    trend. Many formal methods exist for &quot;drawing&quot; the trend.</p>
    <p><strong>Variance</strong>:&nbsp; Var(x) = E( [x - mean(x)]^2 )</td>
