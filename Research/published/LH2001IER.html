&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract = {The economic performance of U.S.
immigrants differs substantially from that of natives in ways that pose
difficulties for standard theories of migration. In particular,
immigrants cluster geographically and are often employed together.
Immigrant earnings differ by origin and time spent in the United
States, even after controlling for education and experience. A large
fraction of immigrants eventually returns home, even to low-wage
countries. This article offers a theory of international migration
based on assortative matching under imperfect information that accounts
for a broad range of these empirical regularities.},<br>
