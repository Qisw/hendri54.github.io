&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract = {This article argues that a satisfactory
theory of wealth inequality should account not only for the marginal
distribution of wealth, but also for the joint distribution of wealth
and earnings. The article describes the joint distribution of
retirement wealth and lifetime earnings in the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics. It then evaluates the ability of a stochastic life-cycle
model to account for key features of this distribution. The life-cycle
model fails to account for three key features of the data. (1) The
correlation between lifetime earnings and retirement wealth is too
high. (2) The wealth gaps between earnings rich and earnings poor
households are too large. (3) Wealth inequality among households with
similar lifetime earnings is too small. Models in which households
differ in rates of return or time preferences account much better for
the joint distribution of retirement wealth and lifetime earnings.},<br>
