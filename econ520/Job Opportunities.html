<h1>Job Opening at Analysis Group (2013 Sep)</h1><span style="font-family: Verdana;">

Analysis Group (AG) provides economic consulting services, financial
guidance, and strategic counsel to corporations, law firms, government
agencies and other non-profit institutions.&nbsp; Our clients include
Fortune 500 companies spanning a number of industries (such as
Microsoft, JP Morgan, and Walt Disney).&nbsp; We have a wide range of
expertise, in areas including antitrust, energy, entertainment,
environment and natural resources, health care, intellectual property,
labor and employment, securities, and tax.&nbsp; In addition, we work
with internal experts and world-renowned academic affiliates, such as
Glenn Hubbard (Dean of Columbia Business School), Robert Hall (Hoover
Institution), and Ted Snyder (Dean of Yale University School of
Management).&nbsp; Analysts are given the flexibility to pursue
casework in fields that interest them through a variety of tasks
ranging from conducting economic analyses for litigation support, to
conducting market research for a strategic growth project, to
co-authoring publications in leading academic journals.&nbsp; This
combination provides the ideal environment for almost anyone, whether
you are looking for exposure in a wide range of industries and business
areas, you want to apply what you learned in economics courses at UNC
in the real world, or you are looking for a corporate environment with
ties to the academic world.
</span><br>
<br>

This is an entry-level position for candidates with research experience
who have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics, finance, statistics,
business, or related subjects. Analysts can expect to work on multiple
projects at a time across multiple practice areas and industries. We
seek candidates with an interest in applying quantitative methods to
real-world research problems, strong interpersonal and communication
skills, a commitment to teamwork and collaborative problem solving, and
aspiration for continuous learning and professional development.
Analysts often move on to top graduate programs for an MBA, JD, or
Ph.D. after their tenure with Analysis Group; some return to the firm
as Associates after graduate school.
<br>

<br>

To apply, please submit your resume, cover letter (including geographic
preference: Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago,
Denver, Menlo Park, New York, or Washington D.C) and unofficial
transcripts through the Career Services Department and the Analysis
Group website by September 29.
<br>
<br>

We will be giving a presentation at UNC on September 25th, from 7-8pm,
in 3250 McColl. Students can feel free to email me directly with
questions they may have. My email is semdadi@analysisgroup.com.
