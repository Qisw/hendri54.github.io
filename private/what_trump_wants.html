<h1 id="interpretingtrump">Interpreting Trump</h1>

<p>Many observers ask: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are Trump&#8217;s policy plans? What does he want to achieve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think these questions fail to understand Trump.</p>

<p>I view all of Trump&#8217;s actions as part of his re-election campaign. He will do whatever makes him popular. </p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The executive order on Obamacare, signed on his first day in office.
The executive order is so vague, it&#8217;s essentially a statement of broad intent. What then is the point? Trump sets himself up to say: &#8220;I kept my promise and repealed Obamacare on my first day in office.&#8221;</p>

<p>In reality, I expect that the repeal of Obamacare will be mainly cosmetic (&#8220;repeal and rename&#8221;). Actually changing Obamacare substantively would be highly unpopular. There is, of course, no plan to cover more people at lower cost. If there were, we would have probably seen some form of public discussion / bragging about it. So the optimal action is to do just enough so Trump can claim that Obamacare has been repealed and is now so much better.</p></li>
<li><p>The inauguration speech</p>

<p>Why this description of America in the dumpster? Quite a bit of it is hard to support with facts. Notably, the economy is doing rather well, except that inequality is extremely high.</p>

<p>The answer is obvious once one views this as a campaign speech. Trump is setting himself up to be able to say: &#8220;Look how awful everything was when I took over. Now it is so much better.&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="update2017-march">Update 2017-March</h2>

<p>A pattern is becoming clearer. Here is the Trumpian recipe for policy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Identify a problem. Something that a group of voters views as a major threat. Examples: loss of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt; rising health care costs.</p></li>
<li>Invent an enemy who supposedly caused the problem.

<ol>
<li>For job losses: international trade (prefably with a specific country: China).</li>
<li>For rising health care costs: Obamacare.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key is: it must be possible to take specific, strong actions against the enemy. So it will not do to blame technology for job losses.</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with a policy against the enemy (tariffs, immigration restrictions, repeal Obamacare).</p></li>
<li><p>Claim that the problem has been solved.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the process, Republicans perform 180 degree reversals of previously held policies (free trade, skilled immigration). Of course, it is somewhat hard to believe that Republicans have collectively changed their minds about many issues since Trump was made the presidential candidate. This is pure cynicism.</p>
