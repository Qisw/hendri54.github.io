<h1 id="theneedforconstitutionalreform">The Need for Constitutional Reform</h1>

<p>America elected Trump.</p>

<p>Congress goes along with all manner of <a href="trump_policies.html">appalling policy proposals</a> made by Trump.</p>

<p>That means the constitution needs to be changed.</p>

<p>The U.S. constitution is 200 years old. It has remained essentially unchanged over the entire period. It does not work any more.</p>

<p>I am not a constitutional scholar, but here is one proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The president should not be elected directly by the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In many countries, voters elect a party. The majority party then chooses a president (or chancellor). This approach prevents a demagogue from coming to power.</p>

<p>Our constitution is not designed to handle a situation where the majority of voters fails to understand basic facts. Now that many voters get their &#8220;news&#8221; from places like Facebook (perhaps it should be called <strong>Fakebook</strong> instead), an additional layer needs to be placed between the choices of the people and the policies that get implemented.</p>
