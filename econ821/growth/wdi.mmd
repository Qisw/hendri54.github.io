# World Development Indicators #

A collection of cross country data on

* gdp and its components

* employment

* demographics

* education

* government finances

* and much more

# Getting the Data #

One typically downloads one variable at a time from [here](http://databank.worldbank.org/).

The best format is probably xls.

One gets a file with years as columns.

## Getting the Data Into Matlab ##

Replace the column headers for the years with something that makes a valid variable name (e.g. x1970).

Run through [Stat/Transfer](www.stattransfer.com) to obtain a Matlab dataset.

Load the file into matlab. Convert the data portion of the matrix into a matrix by [year, country].

Country indicators are World Bank WITS codes (essentially the same as ISO codes).

# Matlab Code #

### Directories ###

wdiDir: base

* progDir: programs

* matDir: generated `mat` files

* outDir: tables and figures

* dataDir: raw data

### Programs

| Program	| Purpose	|  
|  ------	| ------	|  
| go_wdi821	| startup	|  
| init_wdi821	| startup tasks; put dir on path  
| const_wdi821	| define constants  	| 
| run_all_wdi821	| run everything in sequence  
| country_list_wdi821	| make list of country codes / names  
| make_vars_wdi821	| make variables by [year,country]	| 

# Exercises #

1. Construct GDP per worker (i.e. per employed person) in constant international dollars.
	1. Save it as a Matlab matrix by [country, year].
	2. How does it compare with PWT data?

2. Plot the fraction of self-employed workers against GDP per capita in constant international dollars. For the year 2000.
What do you find?

3. Download a variable from the WDI web site and import it into Matlab.
